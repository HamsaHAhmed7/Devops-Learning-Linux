# 🛡️ OverTheWire: Bandit — My Notes, My Struggles, My Wins

Hey there 👋

This is my personal set of notes and write-ups as I work through the [Bandit wargame](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) from OverTheWire. I'm not trying to be fancy here — just documenting the real stuff I did, the commands that worked, what broke, what confused me, and what finally clicked.

If you’re new to Linux, the terminal, or hacking puzzles in general — Bandit is *such* a good place to start. It doesn’t assume much, but it makes you think. I’m using it to sharpen my command line skills and get more comfortable with networking, file permissions, weird shell behavior, and everything in between.

## 💡 What This Is (and Isn’t)

This isn’t some elite hacker write-up with CTF swagger.  
This is:
- The exact commands I ran  
- The passwords I found (yes, I log them because life’s short)  
- My thought process — including the dumb mistakes  
- Occasional side-notes, workarounds, and reflections

Some levels I breezed through. Others I got stuck on longer than I care to admit. That’s part of the game.

This repo is messy on purpose. It’s real. It’s mine. And maybe it helps you too.

## 🧠 Stuff I’m Learning (and You Might Too)

By working through Bandit, I’ve started to build real intuition for:

- Navigating Linux like a boss (`ls`, `cat`, `grep`, `find`, `diff`, etc.)
- Understanding permissions (`chmod`, `setuid`, file ownership)
- Using tools like `ssh`, `scp`, `netcat`, `openssl`, `nmap`
- Thinking like a problem solver, not just a command copy-paster
- Reading man pages without crying 😅
- Knowing when to be curious vs. when to be skeptical

You don’t need to memorize everything. You just need to keep trying. It’ll stick.

## 🛠️ What You’ll Need

- A terminal (Linux, macOS, WSL, or even Git Bash on Windows works fine)
- SSH installed
- A healthy dose of curiosity and patience
- Willingness to Google things and read between the lines

You’ll also start to notice how tools work under the hood — things like ports, encryption, piping input/output — they go from abstract to obvious pretty quickly.

## 🙋‍♂️ Why I’m Doing This

I’m shifting into DevOps and security, and this is part of me laying the foundation — not just so I can pass an interview or certification, but so I can actually understand what’s happening when stuff breaks in production or behaves unexpectedly.

Also: I’ve been stuck before. Like really stuck. On the smallest things.  
So I write these notes in the spirit of community and future-me. If they help you too, even better.

## 🤝 If You Want to Join In

Clone it. Fork it. Copy and paste from it. Zero pressure.

If you’ve got a better solution, cleaner trick, or just want to chat about one of the levels, feel free to open a PR or shoot me a message. I'm here to learn — and swap notes with anyone who’s on the same path.
